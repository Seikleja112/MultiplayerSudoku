# MultyplayerSudoku
A repository to house the code for our project for University of Tartu Distributed Systems.

30.10.17 - The whole group got tohether to come up with the whole idea of how to implement our version of multiplayer sudoku.

         * We decided that we will use a sudoku generator to generate a sudoku board for each new room.
         
         * The protocol headers were decided on and how many we need and the use cases for them, also the info that is transmitted with them.
         
         * We also developed some basic functions for the headers.
         
         * This all was done in Juhans PC.
